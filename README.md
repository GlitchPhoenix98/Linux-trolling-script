# Linux-trolling-script
A python script to troll your friends that use linux! 

Instructions: 

Open the terminal where the python file is located/cd into it, and do the following:
./real

This will start the script in the terminal! Try to distribute this script to your friends without telling them what the script does!

(Is this dumb? Yes. Is it pointless? Yes. But hey! I have to start somewhere.)
